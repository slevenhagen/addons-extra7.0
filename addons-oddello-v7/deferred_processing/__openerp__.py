    "name" : "Base module enabling processing intensive tasks, that othervise would cause UI-server communication timeouts",
    "version" : "1.0",
    "description" : """Problem:
===============================================================
There are number of cases with CPU or database intensive processing tasks, that usually causes user interface to server communication timeouts, which usually block from implementing OpenERP in large enterprises. Usually long running tasks may be caused by either large number of records or CPU/DB intensive algorithms.

Solution:
===============================================================
Process is scheduled and started in a background, so it does not depend on UI-server communication, even if it would run for multiple hours. User can monitor the requested process by refreshing a dedicated Process object (Menu: Administration/Customization/Deferred Processing/Processes). Once finished, results are stored (if applicable) inside the Process object.

The module is a basic foundation, for to start and manage long running tasks like:
===============================================================
* calculate large number of CDR;
* send batch e-mails;
* generate large number of invoices;
* batch reporting/printing;
* generate tax returns;
* import large datasets;
* reconciliate accounts;
* generate payroll;
* recalculate pricelists;
* MRP scheduling;

To implement this functionality you may incorporate interfaces of the module in one of two ways:
===============================================================
* changing OpenERP database configuration manually;
* directly referencing in your custom module (preferred);
